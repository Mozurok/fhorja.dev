**Reference grounding (execution gate).** Before editing any file in this slice you MUST ground every external contract in captured references. This gate is mandatory, not advisory.

1. Detect. Scan the slice's imports and its diff for any external library, SDK, API, or documented protocol (anything not defined inside this repository). A slice whose imports and diff stay entirely internal is exempt: skip the rest of this gate and proceed.

2. Refuse when uncaptured. IF the slice uses an external contract that is not present in `projects/<client>__<project>/REFERENCES.md`, you MUST NOT edit. Stop, name the missing contract in one short refusal block, and route the user to `capture-references` to capture it (official docs, signature, version). This holds in every task tier. Do not fetch the web here; `capture-references` is the only authorized capture path.

3. Read and cite when captured. WHEN the contract is present in `REFERENCES.md`, read that entry (including any `Implementation contract` block) before you write code, and emit a `Grounded in:` line in the execution summary naming each `REFERENCES.md` entry or local doc you relied on. An edit that touches an external contract without a `Grounded in:` line is invalid output.

4. Design assets are external contracts too (ADR-0051). WHEN this slice implements from a design source (Figma node, screen, or component spec), pull the exact node via the design MCP (`get_design_context` / `get_screenshot` / `get_variable_defs`, `download_assets` for real assets) BEFORE editing and build from the pulled values: no placeholder boxes, guessed measurements, or assumed copy. Design-to-code slices are NOT exempt when imports are internal. IF the node is unavailable, stop and ask for the link. Placeholders need an approved `Asset-fidelity: placeholder` decision in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

Do not implement an external API from memory. WHEN the captured entry and your recollection disagree, the captured entry wins (per `WORKFLOW_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md` `## Evidence priority`).
